                            Welcome to the NuGenesis platform: the multi-chain, interoperable network system availing your optimal combination of private, public, open, permission and with degree of decentralisation to suit.

                        <p>
                            Secured by dual layer internal and external Artificial intelligence (AI), it is gasless and carbon neutral.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With unlimited scale and speed, the NuGenesis blockchain infrastructure is the substratum for gasless interactive NFTs, augmented, and virtual reality. The backbone of the metaverse and metarealm.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            NuGenesis did not have an ICO. It funded a complete operational blockchain system itself before NuCoin became available to the public from 23 December 2021. NuGenesis has been working on enterprise and government solutions, particularly for countries seeking to implement Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and infrastructure instruments. Accordingly NuGenesis re-engineered blockchain from inception. A &quot;new&quot; Genesis. New, not only in different and fresh thinking, but &quot;NU&quot; as in N.U. â€“ non-usury.
